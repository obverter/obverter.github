title: "Watching Baseball Is the Most Type 2 Fun You Can Have"

I find baseball compelling in part because it is an endless test of patience and endurance. No other sport brings so vividly to life the act of indeterminate waiting.

Baseball is waiting incarnate. It is waiting at its most elemental.

But that's exactly where the fun is hiding.

Some people might not understand why anyone would watch baseball. It's slow. It's repetitive. And the worse your team is, the longer most losses tend to take.

So why do I watch? Because I enjoy Type 2 fun.

## What is Type 2 Fun?

For the unfamiliar: Type 2 fun is fun in retrospect:

- It's a long hike up a Sisyphean mountain.
- It's wandering drunk through the 3AM streets of London in June 2008 and trying your hostel key on the front door of every house on the wrong block.
- It's every not-your-toddler's birthday party anyone has ever been to.

In other words, it's not the most thrilling way to spend your time, but there is a certain satisfaction that comes from just getting through it.

## Why Baseball is the Most Type 2 Fun Sport There Is

Here's why I think baseball is the most Type 2 fun sport there is:

First of all, there's the sheer length of the games. They can go on for hours and hours, with no guarantee that anything interesting will happen.

Secondly, there are no timeouts or breaks in the action in baseball. This is because the game itself is a kind of timeout. The action is what happens when people forget to stand around.

Finally, there's the fact that baseball games are, in essence, nothing but downtime. There are long pauses between pitches, and even longer pauses between innings.

Even replay reviews — which were conceived as a way for teams to seek relief for egregious failures of umpiring — begin these days with the manager holding up one hand and asking for some extra time to decide whether they're going to decide to ask the umpires to reconsider a decision.

It's the waiting, you see. The waiting seasons the suffer, and the suffer's the spirit of Type 2 Fun.

But therein lies the its beauty, is what I'm saying.

Because in those long stretches of time, we as viewers get to daydream and imagine all sorts of possibilities...

Maybe this will be the inning where everything changes and the team that's been losing all game suddenly starts hitting homeruns left and right.

Maybe I'll find a lucrative, satisfying career.

Maybe this will be the play where the our MVP catcher's left ankle is liquefied during a play at the plate.

In short, baseball is the perfect sport for those moments when you don't want to do anything but don't want to miss out on anything either. It's Type 2 fun at its finest!

## Closing Thought

Next time you find yourself stuck watching a baseball game against your will, take solace in the fact that you're participating in one of life's great Type 2 fun activities!

And who knows? Maybe someday you'll even find yourself enjoying it...in retrospect.
